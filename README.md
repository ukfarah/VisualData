# 📊 Data Visualization Project

## 🧩 Project Description

This project studies a dataset through visual analysis.
Tabular data is transformed into charts.
The focus stays on trends, patterns, and relations.

The work supports data driven interpretation.

## 🎯 Goals

The project aims to:

* 📈 Represent data in visual form
* 📊 Compare values across features
* ⏱ Track change across records
* 🔗 Detect relations between variables

All findings rely on visual evidence.

## 🗂 Dataset

The project uses structured data.
Data is loaded from a CSV source.
Missing values and duplicates are addressed.

Preprocessing follows academic data mining standards.

## 🛠 Methods

The workflow includes:

* 📥 Data loading and inspection
* 🧹 Data cleaning
* 📐 Statistical overview
* 🔍 Visual exploration

Each step links to a plot or table.

## 💻 Tools

The project uses:

* 🐍 Python
* 🧮 Pandas
* 📦 NumPy
* 📉 Matplotlib
* 🎨 Seaborn

These tools appear in IEEE and ACM coursework.

## 📌 Visual Outputs

The project generates:

* 📊 Bar charts for comparison
* 📈 Line charts for progression
* 📉 Histograms for spread
* 📦 Box plots for range
* 🧠 Correlation heatmaps

Each visual answers one defined question.

## 🔎 Analysis

Plots are interpreted through observation.
Increases, decreases, and clusters are reported.
Claims appear only when supported by data.

Key questions:

* 🔁 Which patterns repeat across plots
* 🔗 Which variables move together

## ▶ Execution

Steps to run the project:

* 📂 Open the notebook file
* ▶ Run cells in order
* 👀 Review figures and comments

No setup steps are required.

## 🗃 Repository Structure

* 📄 Data Mining.ipynb
* 📝 README.md

The structure supports fast review.

## 🎓 Applications

This project suits:

* 🏫 University evaluation
* 📚 Course submission
* 💼 Portfolio display
* 🖼 Poster presentation

The scope fits data mining and analytics courses.
